# Bomberman game

## Pupose

The main idea is to build a simple version of the Bomberman game that can be played in the browser. 

My pursonal goal with this fun project is to iron out the basics of OOP with JavaScript and learn new technics such as working with HTML canvas and websokets 
## Goals for the first stage
- get canvas shown and learn working with it (drawing pixels, shapes and setting colors);
- get the characters shown;
- moving the charachter with controls;
- moving the oponent with separate controwls
